- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jacob@Sjatech
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in information Technology matters especially in the utilization of the power of IT to help discover, solve and/or enhance modern science. 
These area my itching fields of interest to learn and contribute:
- Bio-science, nano-science, bio-bricks, medicine, genomics, self-healing structures and science, and microbes
- Energy (green), semi-perpetual, solar src, wind src, energy retention, efficient uses, and wireless transmitions  
- Science and humanity, spirituality, metahpysics, global consciousness, Natural symbosis (plant, animal and other organisms - interactivity, communications, dependecies)
- Quantum computing & quantum science, fractal approaches in uses such as game theory/chaos,  quantum mecahnical models, parallel universe / multiversity / light deflection, bending / gravititional events and  cosmos
- Artificial intelligence, AI frameworks, Neuralinks, 3d and 4d pattern recognitions, memory uploading, crispr and AI, VRML and AI, etc.
- Cyborg, material science, vibration science, force multiplier devices and materials
- Economy, finance, consumption trends, understanding consumers habits, stock and commodity analysis, memory bank, blockchain, international trading, etc.
- gamefications - interactive world and UX (Sound, Audio, Touch, artifical sensory) ... interactive world (audio, visual, touch, artifical sensory, etc) - promotion of global consciousness via conscious gamification  
- Bigdata, Data science, data mining, data analysis, data correlation rules, data cataloging, virtualization and presentation
- Network capabilities, devices, cloud solutions, monitoring, analysis, intrusion detection, predictive patterns, obsfuication, edge computing, data layers and dynamic encryotions
- Programming: insight in most languages and proven and unproven approaches, everything but the kitchen sink, to have diversfied skillset to code just about anything that is humanly and technically possible crossing the fingers for human innovations and discovery, bar none.
- DevSecOps:  modern coolest software and IaC delivery approach with a robust productivity pipeline from idea to realization in bits and pieces, along the way integrating, fusing, forming, messaging status of destinations and health within pipeline and/or the final resting places
- CI/CD/CD: Continious Integration, Delivery and Deployment - KPI - faster, in smaller chunks, quality and security gates, test and make available faster, feedback streams, automations, toolchains, 
- Cloud computing: Edge computing, hybrid and multi cloud approaches, cloud resources and services, afforable cloud availablility to developing countries and rular area.
- Life: live it to the fullest and remember to make my daily wish for every living thing to have the best there can be attained.
- Hobbies:  woodwork, mechanics, family time, biking, sports, movie, international music, langauge, cultures      
- I‚Äôm currently mostly working in the IT world supports various projects based on projects assigned by my employer - I hope time will afford me to write books, teach the young and the restless and participate in cool IT and science projects 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôll be looking to collaborate on open source projects in the near fucture but currently I am focused in my employer's work related matters.
As I stated, it is my today's wish for you to have a blessed and fullfiling day!
üì´  Thank you!
